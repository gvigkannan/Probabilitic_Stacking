# Grasp Detection - Expert Mixtures
Implement Stacking that considers the Probabilistic Outputs of Different Primitive Algorithms and the Original Dataset considered.
Compare the performance with other Ensemble Techniques including Mixture of Experts, Bagging, Stacking and Voting

Implemented:
Using the listed datasets, the following implementations has been completed
1. Trained Classifiers using Random Forest, SVM, KNN-C, Decision Trees, XGBoost Classifier, LightGBM and Catboost.
2. Combined the above classifiers using Hard and Soft Voting, Mixture of Experts, Stacking.
3. Experimenting with Data inclusive and Probability based stacking approaches to improve overall accuracy.
4. Currently working on Mixture of Experts based models to combine these approaches.

Grasp Detection Files shall be uploaded once the experiments are completed!
